    bio: "Alex Marston, born in Royal Oak, Michigan, was introduced at a young age to computers and software through his father, a software engineer. Rushing home from school, Alex would race to his room to take apart and modify his desktop just to understand how and why a computer works. He fully immersed himself in the realm of coding when he was 30 and has pushed his limits ever since. He is experienced in HTML5, CSS and SASS/SCSS. Also, he is skilled in utilizing certain front-end libraries like Bootstrap, Jquery, and React, and application data-flow architectures such as Redux.\n“Programming is what I am meant to do; Teaching others to see the same thing is my purpose.”, Alex says as a smile comes across his face. Because of his justice involvement, Alex has discovered a hidden drive and passion to help others succeed. He has found a love to teach, and as an assistant instructor, he has pushed others to see their capabilities.",

    bio: "Alex Fagan, born in Oak Ridge, Tn, is a junior web developer with an intense passion for learning. Although he started his career recently he is working his way to become as proficient as he can in multiple languages including HTML5, CSS, Javascript and using front-end libraries such as React. He is taking advantage of the opportunity that was given to him as an ex-offender to do everything he can to make a better life for himself. He sees web development as the path that can lead him to that better life. While he sees himself as a novice when it comes to technology, he feels his desire and driven mentality gives him an edge. He hopes to one day become a full-stack developer.\nOutside of web development, Alex enjoys playing basketball, video games and reading. He has a goal to go back to college and attain a degree in Computer Sciences. He sees the stepping stones laid by the people around him and these give him hope that his future goals are very attainable. Going forward in life is something he is determined to do but understands that the path is not going to be easy, which is why he works so hard to develop every part of his life whether it be coding, growing as a human or his relationships with family and friends.",
